The feature extraction code of "BAMS-FE: Band-by-Band Adaptive Multiscale Superpixel Feature Extraction for Hyperspectral Image Classification". Here we provide two versions of the BAMS algorithm: one in Python and the other in MATLAB. The Python version requires calling MATLAB functions. The algorithm used in our paper is based on the Python version. The file ERS.m needs to call the entropy superpixels segmentation algorithm, which is available as an open-source algorithm on GitHub. Please make sure to prepare this algorithm before running the code.
